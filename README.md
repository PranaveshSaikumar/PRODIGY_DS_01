# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis
This is my repository for Prodigy Infotech Internship! These documents are for the task 1 of my internship program on data analysis and categorical representation.

#Task Obejctive:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the disctribution of ages or genders in a population.

#Insights:
Creating visualizations like bar charts or histograms is essential for understanding distributions of categorical or continuous variables in datasets, enabling clear insights into data trends. These visualizations enhance data exploration by providing intuitive representations of frequency distributions and comparisons within populations.
